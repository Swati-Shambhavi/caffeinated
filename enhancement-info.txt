This 
1. Containerized my Spring Boot app:
Used Google jib to dockerize it. 
Useful commads:
i>  mvn compile jib:dockerBuild  --------->>>> to build a docker image
ii> docker run -e DATABASE_URL=<db_url>\
           -e DATABASE_USERNAME=<db_username> \
           -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=<db_password> \
           -p 8080:8080 <image_name:tag>  --------->>>> To run the docker container, I have configured my app in such a way that I need to pass data soruce as environment variables.
